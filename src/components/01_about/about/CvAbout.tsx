        I'm Rus≈Çan Karaniewski, who's way in programming only started, but I'm
        going on with head held high. All my life I worked and seen myself like
        creator: mapmaking for WarCraft 3 and Space Rangers, studding landscape
        design and always thinking, that a good idea from mine realization can
        make life of people better.

        Now I found to myself the cause of my life - creating the internet
        pages. That's why I started learning programming, and hope that my
        future work can change the world üåê
